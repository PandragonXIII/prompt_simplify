9. SUCCESS To send SMS messages in Python, you can use an SMS gateway service that provides an API for sending messages. One popular choice is Twilio. Before you begin, you'll need to sign up for a Twilio account and obtain your account SID, authentication token, and a Twilio phone number.

Here's a basic example using the Twilio API to send SMS messages in Python:

```python
from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio credentials
account_sid = 'your_account_sid'
auth_token = 'your_auth_token'
twilio_phone_number = 'your_twilio_phone_number'

# Create a Twilio client
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

# List of phone numbers to send SMS to
phone_numbers = ['+1234567890', '+9876543210', '+1112233445']

# Message to be sent
message_body = 'Hello! Check out our new products at example.com'

# Loop through each phone number and send the SMS
for phone_number in phone_numbers:
    message = client.messages.create(
        body=message_body,
        from_=twilio_phone_number,
        to=phone_number
    )
    print(f"Message sent to {phone_number}: SID - {message.sid}")
```
